# Proposal

*Insert your proposal here, overwriting this text. Please include the complete proposal, rather than linking to a gist or other external document.*

*Your proposal doesn't have to be long. It should however be in sufficient detail that people familiar with the code can clearly envision what you are planning to do. Be sure to link to any relevant issues, PRs, or other sources.*

# Mentors or Reviewers

*If you have a reviewer or mentor in mind for this work, mention then
here. You can put your own name here if you are planning to mentor the
work.*

# Process

The main points of the [Major Change Process][MCP] is as follows:

* [x] File an issue describing the proposal.
* [ ] A compiler team member or contributor who is knowledgeable in the area can **second** by writing `@rustbot second`.
    * Finding a "second" suffices for internal changes. If however you are proposing a new public-facing feature, such as a `-C flag`, then full team check-off is required.
    * Compiler team members can initiate a check-off via `@rfcbot fcp merge` on either the MCP or the PR.
* [ ] Once an MCP is seconded, the Final Comment Period begins. If no objections are raised after 10 days, the MCP is considered **approved**.
